# Sous Project

A starter kit for your Drupal project that simplifies your project setup with [Emulsify](https://www.emulsify.info/). This starter kit includes a small set
of contrib modules, a bundle of basic configuration, and a starter theme generated by [EmulsifyCLI](https://docs.emulsify.info/supporting-projects/emulsify-cli).

## Features and Configurations

Sous not only generates a custom theme based on Emulsify, it also builds upon Drupal's default configuration to help streamline the project setup process. See the feature set documentation [here](docs/features.md).

# Installation

## Requirements

Without these you will have difficulty installing this project.

1. [PHP ^8.1](http://www.php.net/)
2. [Composer 2.x](https://getcomposer.org/)
3. [Lando ^3.6](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html)

Use this command below and replace `PROJECT_NAME` with your chosen project name.

```
composer create-project fourkitchens/sous-drupal-project [PROJECT-NAME] --no-interaction
```

## Tweak project

- Modify .gitignore
  - Remove the commented block at the EOF
  - Review ignored items you may need for your build and remove them

## Optional Demo content and theme

Sous can optionally install some demo content and a fully styled and wired theme. Note: This should only be ran immediately after installation. It contains basic content type and media architecture changes and may affect custom configuration unexpectedly.

`lando sous-demo-install`

# Working with Emulsify

The [Emulsify](https://emulsify.info/) theme is installed as part of this project.

# Additional Tooling

This package provides some additional tooling to support the build.


## Helper scripts

To use the helper script provided you will need to have `npm` installed. Then just run `npm run <command>`. For example: `npm run import-data`. These commands are bash scripts located in the `./scripts/sous` directory and defined in `package.json`.

## Configuration management scripts

**confex**

```
npm run confex
```

Export active configuration to the config directory.

**confim**

```
npm run confim
```

Import the configuration to the database.

**import-data**

```
npm run import-data
```

Import a copy of the canonical database backup into your local instance. This assumes the database backup is located in `./reference/db.sql.gz`.

**local-data-bak**

```
npm run local-data-bak
```

Create a local database backup. Saves the backup to the `./reference` directory.

**rebuild**

```
npm run rebuild
```

Rebuild a fresh local instance of your site. Imports the canonical database backup and imports configuration into it.

**setup**

```
npm run setup
```

This is run during the installation process of composer create project.

**theme-build**

```
npm run theme-build
```

Builds the emulsify based theme.

**theme-watch**

```
npm run theme-watch
```

Used for theme development.

# Semantic Versioning

## Setup

1. This repo has the following named/maintenance branches:

```
main
x.x
x.x.x
```

2. These branches are protected on GitHub
3. A personal access token was created for CircleCI.
4. CircleCI was setup to run on this project and tag the releases
5. Commit changes following the [Conventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
6. Push your change up and verify CircleCI passes and has run on your desired branch.

## Troubleshooting

1. Your branch must be a named stable release branch in order to get a tag.
2. Prereleases are not supported with this package because they contain a dot.

# Contributing

The composer command can be adjusted to account for a new branch you're working on.

```
composer create-project fourkitchens/sous-drupal-project:dev-[branch-name] PROJECT_NAME --no-interaction
```

## Contribute without create-project

1. clone repo `gh repo clone fourkitchens/sous-drupal-project [directory]`
2. `cd` to your project directory
3. change the name of your project in .lando.yml
4. `lando start`
5. `lando composer install`
6. `composer run-script post-create-project-cmd` (Requires composer to be installed locally. i.e. outside lando)
7. `lando drush config-set system.theme default theme-name -y` (_theme-name_ is the name of your project)

After running the above steps you should have a fully functioning Drupal site with a custom Emulsify theme named after your project.

### Create a custom theme. (Change theme-name to your theme name.)

If you would like to generate another custom theme follow the steps below.

1. `npm ci`
2. `npx emulsify init theme-name`
3. `lando drush config-set system.theme default theme-name -y`
